# UFOs
## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of a UFO sightings data. For this project, users will be able to allow users to filter the data with more than just the date. Additional filters for the table will include city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Users will be able to filter data, simply by inputting a criteria into one of the filter fields. The webpage will then automatically filter the table to display relevant data. The first image ilustrates the table without filters. Users can see the type of format that is required for the filter to function in the text box. When there is an input, the table will automatically filter the results accordingly.

## Summary
One drawback of this design of this is that it is not device responsive. The webpage does not change its format when it is switched over with other devices.
To further develop this, the webpage has to be formatted so that regardless of the device being used, the full content of the webpage will be formatted to fit the screen.  
Another addition that can be made to the webpage is a survey form. The survey would ask about the users' their experiences with extraterrestial sightings. It can include questions such as a description for what they saw, duration, general geographic location, and other interesting details. This way, it can expand and table and database by including new user sightings.
